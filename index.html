						<h2> About Me</h2>
				
				 	   	<p style="font-style:Times New Roman;"><img style="width:250px;float:right;margin-left:10px 10px;border-style:solid;border-color:black;" src="images/casual.png"/>My name is Miles Reyes. I am 13 years old and an eighth grader attending <a href="http://www.nlmusd.k12.ca.us/Domain/13">Los Coyotes Middle School</a>. I take honors classes and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I am involved in ASB Leadership, planning, hosting and setting up audio equipment for various events includuing dances.  My favorite subject is science and I enjoy the labs we do in class. Recently, I set a record in my class for the farthest distance traveled, 12.9 meters, with a Newton Vehicle. I am very outgoing and I like to participate in extracurricular actvities. I started a gaming club at my school with some of my friends. We mainly play strategy games in four on four matches. The gaming club was created to enhance teambuilding and communication skills while having a good time. My family has rescued four different animals, a gopher snake, a tortoise, and our two dogs.

						<h2> Interests</h2>
					
						<p>I have always had a love of technology ever since I saw my brother make his own computer and watched it boot up for the first time. At home, I enjoy watching <a href="http://www.formula1.com"> Formula One</a> racing with my dad. I also have an interest in space flight programs and have been to see the Endeavour exhibit at California Science Center. I enjoy cinematography and have many favorite directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, and Quetin Tarantino. I have two rescue dogs, one who is 18 years old and another who is three years old,recently rescued.  I have been swimming since I was three and consider myself a good swimmer and naturally interested in playing water polo for Brea.
