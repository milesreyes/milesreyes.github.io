						<h2> About Me</h2>
				
				 	   	<p style="font-style:Times New Roman;"><img style="width:250px;float:right;margin-left:10px 10px;border-style:solid;border-color:black;" src="images/casual.png"/>My name is Miles Reyes. I am 13 years old and an eighth grader attending <a href="http://www.nlmusd.k12.ca.us/Domain/13"><i>Los Coyotes Middle School</i></a>. I take honors classes and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I am involved in ASB Leadership, planning, hosting and setting up audio equipment for various events including dances.  My favorite subject is science and I enjoy the labs we do in class. Recently, I set a record in my class for the farthest distance traveled, 12.9 meters, with a Newton Vehicle. I am very outgoing and I like to participate in extracurricular actvities. I started a gaming club at my school with some of my friends. We mainly play strategy games in four on four matches. The gaming club was created to enhance teambuilding and communication skills while having a good time.

							I love animals and have rescued four different animals, a gopher snake, a tortoise, and two dogs, one who is 18 years old and another who is three years old, recently rescued. I have an older sister who is currently attending the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu"><i>University of Pennsylvania</i></a> and an older brother who recently graduated from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml"> <i>Carnegie Mellon University</i></a>. Both of my siblings have been role models to me. I plan to follow in their footsteps and attend Carnegie Mellon.

						<h2> Interests</h2>
					

						<p>I have always had an interest in technology since I saw my brother build his own computer and watched it boot up for the first time. At home, I enjoy watching <a href="http://www.formula1.com"><i> Formula One</i></a> racing with my dad. I also enjoy watching programs about space and I have been to see the Endeavour exhibit at the California Science Center. I enjoy cinematography and have many favorite directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, and Quentin Tarantino. I have been swimming since I was three and consider myself a good swimmer and I would like to play water polo for Brea Olinda.
